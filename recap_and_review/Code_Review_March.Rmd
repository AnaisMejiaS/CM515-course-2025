## Some questions from class

### Equality and assignment operators

The arrow notation `varname <- value` is equivalent to `varname = value`. It exists for backward compatibility in R's beginnings from S, which descended from something called APL which was designed a long time ago for a different keyboard that had a lot of mathematical symbols.

There it is, next to the P key.

The following are equivalent:

1. `varname = value`

2. `varname <- value`

3. `value -> varname` **WHAT**

```{r R assignment, echo=T}
cat("1. using the =\n")  # print this message
varname = 3              # make assignment with '='
varname                  # check that it's right

cat("2. using the <-\n") # print this message
varname <- 3             # make assignment with '<-'
varname                  # should read `[1] 3`

cat("3. using the ->\n") # print this message
3 -> varname             # make assignment with '<-'
varname                  # still reads `[1] 3` 

```

One benefit is the left-right flow of a pipe demonstrated below.


```{r as the receiver of pipes}

# as the result of a pipe: start to finish
# start %>% function %>% .. -> finish
mtcars %>% select(wt,qsec) -> arrow_left_to_right

# ARE THEY REALLY THE SAME?

arrow_right_to_left <- mtcars %>% select(wt,qsec) 
equal_sign_right_to_left = mtcars %>% select(wt,qsec) 

cat("Should be three lines of `[1] TRUE`\n")
all.equal(arrow_right_to_left, equal_sign_right_to_left)
all.equal(arrow_left_to_right, equal_sign_right_to_left)
all.equal(arrow_left_to_right, arrow_right_to_left)
```

## Operators and functions for Comparison

### Basic comparisons

Every language has a type called `boolean` or `logical` with only two possible values: TRUE and FALSE.

```
> var == 3
[1] TRUE
```

R is vector-centric, and its strength as a language is in cases like the one below:

```{r vector comparisons to a single value}

vec = c(1,2,3,4)

vec == 3
```



```{r vector comparisons to a single value (multiple matches) }
# this time vec has more than one TRUE element

vec = c(3,1,2,3,4,3)

vec == 3  # vector of logicals (TRUE is 3, FALSE otherwise)
```


There are many applications for this. One is for indexing:


```{r vector comparisons for indexing }
# this time vec has more than one TRUE element

vec = c(3,1,2,3,4,3)

vec == 3  # vector of logicals (TRUE is 3, FALSE otherwise)

which(vec == 3)  # any position (INDEX) of a TRUE element

indices = which(vec == 3)

vec[indices] # extract the values that are '3'

```


```{r a more useful case of indexing }
# this time vec has more than one TRUE element

vec = c(3,1,2,3,4,3)

vec >= 3  # vector of logicals (TRUE >= 3, FALSE otherwise)

which(vec >= 3)  # the INDEX of the TRUE elements

indices = which(vec >= 3)

vec[ indices ]

```

### More functions to work with comparisons and logicals

#### the number of true comparisons

```{r working with logicals}
# this time vec has more than one TRUE element

vec = c(3,1,2,3,4,3)

cat("vec:\n")
vec

vec >= 3  # vector of logicals (TRUE >= 3, FALSE otherwise)

cat("The number of elements >= 3\n")

sum(vec >= 3)

```
#### one value summarizing all comparisons

```{r summary functions any and all}
vec = c(3,1,2,3,4,3)
any(vec >= 3) # TRUE
all(vec >= 3) # FALSE

```

## Applications for pipes

```{r}
mpg = ggplot2::mpg     # load mpg from pkg
table(mpg$class)       # how many of each type

mpg$class == 'minivan' # returns a  vector of TRUE/FALSE the same 
                       # length as the number of rows in mpg.
                       # TRUE when class is minivan, else FALSE

###### The following are equivalent
# 1. Base R (no pipes). Subset by a logical vector the same length as nrows(mpg)
mini1 = mpg[ mpg$class == 'minivan', ] 
dim(mini1) # 11 rows, 11 columns

# 2. Base R. Ask for specific rows by row number
which_rows_are_minivans = which(mpg$class == 'minivan')
which_rows_are_minivans

mini2 = mpg[ which_rows_are_minivans, ]
dim(mini2)

# same result ???
mini1 == mini2       # cell-wise comparison gives a table of TRUE/FALSE
all(mini1 == mini2)  # do all cells of the dataframes match?

# now using filter(), a dplyr function, but not using a pipe
mini3 = filter(mpg, class == 'minivan')

mini2 == mini3        # cell-wise comparison gives a table of TRUE/FALSE
all(mini2 == mini3)   # do all cells of the dataframes match?

# Now using dplyr filter() with pipes
# A Pipe is written left-to-right
# start      %>%       operation(s)                        -> finish
mpg          %>%   filter(class == 'minivan')              -> mini4
# dataframe  %>%  filter function with logical expression  -> variable name

mini3 == mini4
all(mini3 == mini4)

# all of mini1 mini2 mini3 and mini4 are identical (transitive property of equality)


# you CANNOT pass indices directly to filter()
mpg  %>%  filter(which(class == 'minivan'))  # this is an error
# but you can make an expression with row_number, %in%, and which, that works


mpg  %>%  filter(row_number(mpg) %in% which(class == 'minivan')) -> mini5 # this works, but is unnecessary and clunky


mini4 == mini5
all(mini4 == mini5)
```
