## GGplot Review

### Learning objectives

-   GGPlot
    -   Mapping your dataframe columns to axes
    -   Choosing a geometry for different visualizations
    -   Modifying plot specifics

### GGPlot Basic structure

What are the 3 minimum parts to make a plot using ggplot2?

```         
ggplot(..., aes(...))   +   ...
        /\       /\          /\
        1.       2.           3.
```

Give a description and example for each:

1.  

2.  

3.  

### Constructing plots

Look at this plot of data from ***mpg***:

![Plot of MPG data](mpg_data_plot1.png)

Answer these questions:

1.  What are the axes?
2.  What aesthetics are mapped?
3.  What is the geometry?

```{r reproduce graph 1, echo=T}

# Reproduce the inline graph using the mpg dataset and ggplot2

# uncomment: ggplot(..., aes(...)) + ...


```

Another graph, this time using the births data

Read-in US Births data again.

```{r}
usb = read.csv("https://github.com/Colorado-State-University-CMB/CM515-course-2025/raw/refs/heads/main/modules/05_GGplot_Visualization/2025/US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv")
```


Reproduce the following graph:

![Plot of US births data](usbirths_plot1.png)

```{r reproduce graph 2, echo=T, include = T}
# uncomment and fill in: ggplot(..., aes(x=..., y=...)) + geom_...() + ...
ggplot(usb, aes(x=day_of_week, y=births)) + geom_jitter() + ggtitle("US births data")
```
