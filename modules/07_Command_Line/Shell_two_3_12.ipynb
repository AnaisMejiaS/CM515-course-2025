    "* **Don’t use spaces.**  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spaces can make a name more meaningful, but since spaces are used to separate arguments on the command line it is better to avoid them in names of files and directories. You can use **-** or **_** instead (e.g. **north-pacific-gyre/** rather than **north pacific gyre/**). To test this out, try typing **mkdir north pacific gyre** and see what directory (or directories!) are made when you check with **ls -F**.\n",

We use it in examples because it is one of the least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and macOS), many programmers use Emacs or Vim (both of which require more time to learn), or a graphical editor such as Gedit or VScode. On Windows, you may wish to use Notepad++. Windows also has a built-in editor called notepad that can be run from the command line in the same way as nano for the purposes of this lesson. \n",

If you start it from the shell, it will (probably) use your current working directory as its default location. If you use your computer’s start menu, it may want to save files in your Desktop or Documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to another directory the first time you ‘Save As…’*\n",

However, most people use two-part names most of the time to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds of files apart. The second part of such a name is called the filename extension and indicates what type of data the file holds: **.txt** signals a plain text file, **.pdf** indicates a PDF document, **.cfg** is a configuration file full of parameters for some program or other, **.png** is a PNG image, and so on.\n",

For example, typing **ls \\*.pdf** in the **alkanes** directory (which contains only files with names ending with **.pdb**) results in an error message that there is no file called **\\*.pdf**. However, generally commands like **wc** and **ls** see the lists of file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards themselves.
