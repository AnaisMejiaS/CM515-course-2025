## File formats in biology

Many file formats in biology are plain text, but conform to a certain
structure.

-   Sequences- DNA, RNA, protein

-   Sequence reads - fastq

-   Sequence Alignments- MAF, SAM/BAM

-   Phylogenetic trees - Newick, Phylip

-   Genomic Coordinates and Annotations - BED, GTF, GFF

-   Microscopy images - tiff, raw

-   Protein Structure - pdb

-   Mass Spectrography

-   Analysis output â€“ tidy data, csv

-   Compressed files - gzip, tar, zip

## DNA/RNA and Amino Acid Sequences

Purpose:

-   Understand sequence content, properties.

-   Domains/Structure/Function.

-   Variation: SNPs, indels, transitions/transversions.

-   Identity of a gene, relationship to other genes, other species
    (paralogs/orthologs).

-   Next-gen sequencing- the presence and identity of the sequence is a
    measurement (a count of expressed transcripts, enriched fragments)

-   Design primers for PCR

### FASTA Format

Comes from FAST sequence aligner. Fast**n**: nucleotide; Fast**p**:
protein: Fast**a**: all.

Definition:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format>

<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/fastaformat/>

1.  Header line starts with "\>" followed by the name of the sequence.
    More information can be provided but must be on the same line.
2.  Sequence follows on one or more lines.
3.  Multiple header/sequence pairs can be in the same file (sometimes
    this is called "multi-fasta")

Examples:

```         
>gi|1817694395|ref|NZ_JAAGMU010000151.1| Streptomyces sp. SID7958 contig-52000002, whole genome shotgun sequence
CCGGCTGGCGCGGCTGGCGCTGGCGGTGGGGCTGCGGCTGCTGGAGCTGGGGGTGGCGCTGGAGGCGCAC
GGCCAGAACCTGCTGGTGGTGCTGTCGCCGTCCGGGGAGCCGCGGCGGCTGGTCTACCGCGATCTGGCGG
ACATCCGGGTCTCCCCCGCGCGGCTGGCCCGGCACGGTATCCGGGTTCCGGACCTGCCGGCG

>gi|1643051563|gb|SZWM01000399.1| Citrobacter sp. TBCS-14 contig3128, whole genome shotgun sequence
GCACAGTGAGATCAGCATTCCGTTGGATCTACTGGTCAATCAAAACCTGACGCTGGGTACTGAATGGAAC
CAGCAGCGCATGAAGGACATGCTGTCTAACTCGCAGACCTTTATGGGCGGTAATATTCCAGGCTACAGCA
GCACCGATCGCAGCCCATATTCGAAAGCCGAGATCTTCTCTTTGTTTGCCGAAAACAACATG
```

These sequences have a complex header with multiple, \|-delimited
fields.

What's missing? Sequence annotations and features.

-   Example: Say there is a stem-loop at position 150-200. Have to
    record it separately.

-   Exception: masking with uppercase/lowercase, or another symbol (i.e.
    N, X)

#### Masking

Sequence aligners are often tripped up by short repeat fragments and low
complexity regions. RepeatMasker is a common tool for finding repeats
and *masking* them.

One convention is to use the character N for a hard-masked DNA sequence,
or use lowercase letters for softmasking. *This doesn't work if N is
being used for an ambiguity (the exact base at that position is
uncertain).*

##### Hard Masking

(David made this example up)

In the Streptomyces example above, replace nucleotide letter with 'N' if
sequence is in a repeat (found by RepeatMasker)

```         
CCGGCTGGCGCGGCTGGCGCTGGCGGTGGGGCTGCGGCTGCTGGAGCTGGGGGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNCTGGTCTACCGCGATCTGGCGG
ACATCCGGGTCTCCCCCGCGCGGCTGGCCCGGCACGGTATCCGGGTTCCGGACCTGCCGGCG
```

Software that deals with sequence analysis will be forced to ignore the
N's., but maintain the spacing.

##### Soft Masking

Sometimes you want to retain the sequence, but convey that it is masked.
This is usually done with the masked bases being converted to lowercase.

```         
CCGGCTGGCGCGGCTGGCGCTGGCGGTGGGGCTGCGGCTGCTGGAGCTGGGGGtggcgctggaggcgcac
ggccagaacctgctggtggtgctgtcgccgtccggggagccgcggcggCTGGTCTACCGCGATCTGGCGG
ACATCCGGGTCTCCCCCGCGCGGCTGGCCCGGCACGGTATCCGGGTTCCGGACCTGCCGGCG
```

Software might not take case into account, it depends on the
application, and behavior can be configured.

### In R

```{r fasta, include=FALSE}
# include=FALSE above because there are a lot of info messages when loading this library (clutters output)
library(Biostrings)
```

```{r fasta read in}

# Read from a fasta file
seqs = readDNAStringSet("seqs_for_markdown.fasta")
seqs

# Save the names because they are long, and use shorter ones
long_names = names(seqs)
names(seqs) = c("Streptomyces","Citrobacter")
seqs
```

```{r}
# Some functions

## Dinucleotide frequencies
oligonucleotideFrequency(seqs[1], 2)
oligonucleotideFrequency(seqs[2], 1, as.prob=T)


# look at hexamers for the most common ones
hexamer_frequencies = oligonucleotideFrequency(seqs[1], 6) # matrix of one row, 4096 columns
hexamer_frequencies[1,1:10] # can't use head on a wide object like this
descending_order = order(hexamer_frequencies, decreasing = TRUE) # returns the INDEX of the the largest hex frequency, followed by the next largest, etc.
descending_order[1:10] # top 10 hexamer indices
hexamer_frequencies[,descending_order[1:10]] # top ten hexamers (in a matrix)
top10 = names(hexamer_frequencies[,descending_order[1:10]]) # get the hexamers from the names


# turn the top10 into a sequence object
dict0 = DNAStringSet(top10)
pdict0 = PDict(dict0) # PDict for Pattern DICTionary

# find the occurences of the top 10 hexamers in the sequence
matches = matchPDict(pdict0, seqs[[1]])
for (i in 1:10) {print(top10[i]); print(replaceAt(seqs[[1]], matches[[i]], value = 'NNNNNN'))}
```

```{r Biostrings example}
expectedDinucleotideFrequency <- function(x)
{
    # Individual base frequencies.
    bf <- alphabetFrequency(x, baseOnly=TRUE)[DNA_BASES]
    (as.matrix(bf) %*% t(bf) - diag(bf)) / length(x)
}

## On Celegans chrI:
library(BSgenome.Celegans.UCSC.ce11)
chrI <- Celegans$chrI
obs_df <- dinucleotideFrequency(chrI, as.matrix=TRUE)
obs_df  # CG has the lowest frequency
exp_df <- expectedDinucleotideFrequency(chrI)
## A sanity check:
stopifnot(as.integer(sum(exp_df)) == sum(obs_df))

## Ratio of observed frequency to expected frequency:
obs_df / exp_df  # TA has the lowest ratio, not CG!
```

## Annotation Databases

Gene annotations, sequences, other data that can be mapped to genes from
a variety of sources/experiments.

They don't have the rest of the gene cluster!?!?!

### Exercise as a group

Purpose: brainstorm how to represent data in a dataframe

**What would be a good tidy way to represent track data in a
dataframe?**

-   What would the rows be?
-   What would the columns be?
-   How many observations per row?

```{r helper_func, include=FALSE}
# Just run this code chunk
gff_gene_to_bed <- function(gene_features, gene_id = NA) {
  # Convert start to 0-based for BED format
  bed_start <- min(start(gene_features)) - 1
  bed_end <- max(end(gene_features))

  # If present, extract CDS regions (for thickStart and thickEnd) 
  # if not, use bed start/end
  cds <- gene_features[mcols(gene_features)$type == "CDS", ]
  thick_start <- ifelse(length(cds) > 0, min(start(cds)) - 1, bed_start)
  thick_end <- ifelse(length(cds) > 0, max(end(cds)), bed_end)
  
  exons <- gene_features[mcols(gene_features)$type == "exon", ]
  block_count <- length(exons)
  if (block_count > 0)
  {
    if (as.logical(strand(exons)[1] == '+'))
    {
        block_sizes <- paste(width(exons), collapse = ",")
    } 
    else 
    {
        block_sizes <- paste(rev(width(exons)), collapse = ",")
    }
    block_starts <- paste(sort(start(exons) - bed_start - 1), collapse = ",")    
  }
  
  # Construct BED format
  bed_line <- data.frame(
  chrom = paste("chr",as.character(seqnames(gene_features)[1]),sep=''),
  start = bed_start,
  end = bed_end,
  name = gene_id,
  score = 1000, # 0-1000
  strand = as.character(strand(gene_features)[1]),
  thickStart = thick_start,
  thickEnd = thick_end,
  itemRgb = "0",  # Default value for BED
  blockCount = block_count,
  blockSizes = block_sizes,
  blockStarts = block_starts
  )

  bed_line
}
```

```{r GFF}

hoxA4 = import("hoxA4.gff")
```

### GFF format definition

<https://useast.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/gff.html>

Fields Fields must be tab-separated. Also, all but the final field in
each feature line must contain a value; "empty" columns should be
denoted with a '.'

1.  seqname - name of the chromosome or scaffold; chromosome names can
    be given with or without the 'chr' prefix. Important note: the
    seqname must be one used within Ensembl, i.e. a standard chromosome
    name or an Ensembl identifier such as a scaffold ID, without any
    additional content such as species or assembly. See the example GFF
    output below.
2.  source - name of the program that generated this feature, or the
    data source (database or project name)
3.  feature - feature type name, e.g. Gene, Variation, Similarity
4.  start - Start position\* of the feature, with sequence numbering
    starting at 1.
5.  end - End position\* of the feature, with sequence numbering
    starting at 1.
6.  score - A floating point value.
7.  strand - defined as + (forward) or - (reverse).
8.  frame - One of '0', '1' or '2'. '0' indicates that the first base of
    the feature is the first base of a codon, '1' that the second base
    is the first base of a codon, and so on..
9.  attribute - A semicolon-separated list of tag-value pairs, providing
    additional information about each feature.

#### Our example from dog

| seq | src     | feat  | start    | stop     | 6   | 7   | 8   | Attributes                                                                                               |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 14  | Ensembl | gene  | 40378329 | 40397144 | .   | \-  | .   | ID=**ENSCAFG00805011771.1**;Name=ENSCAFG00805011771.1;biotype=protein_coding                             |
| 14  | Ensembl | trans | 40378329 | 40397144 | .   | \-  | .   | ID=ENSCAFT00805021651.1;Name=ENSCAFT00805021651.1;Parent=**ENSCAFG00805011771.1**;biotype=protein_coding |
| 14  | Ensembl | exon  | 40396965 | 40397144 | .   | \-  | .   | Name=ENSCAFE00805100774;Parent=ENSCAFT00805021651.1                                                      |

Some annoyances:

-   No built-in name or attribute with "HOXA4". Could be added.

-   Gene-relevant sub-features are separated on different rows

-   Hard to read

#### BED - (Browser Extensible Data)

UCSC Genome Browser

1.  chrom - The name of the chromosome (e.g. chr3, chrY, chr2_random) or
    scaffold (e.g. scaffold10671). Many assemblies also support several
    different chromosome aliases (e.g. '1' or 'NC_000001.11' in place of
    'chr1').
2.  chromStart - The starting position of the feature in the chromosome
    or scaffold. The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0.
3.  chromEnd - The ending position of the feature in the chromosome or
    scaffold. The chromEnd base is not included in the display of the
    feature, however, the number in position format will be represented.
    For example, the first 100 bases of chromosome 1 are defined as
    chrom=1, chromStart=0, chromEnd=100, and span the bases numbered
    0-99 in our software (not 0-100), but will represent the position
    notation chr1:1-100. Read more here. chromStart and chromEnd can be
    identical, creating a feature of length 0, commonly used for
    insertions. For example, use chromStart=0, chromEnd=0 to represent
    an insertion before the first nucleotide of a chromosome.
4.  name - Defines the name of the BED line. This label is displayed to
    the left of the BED line in the Genome Browser window when the track
    is open to full display mode or directly to the left of the item in
    pack mode.
5.  score - A score between 0 and 1000. If the track line useScore
    attribute is set to 1 for this annotation data set, the score value
    will determine the level of gray in which this feature is displayed
    (higher numbers = darker gray). This table shows the Genome
    Browser's translation of BED score values into shades of gray:
    shade\
6.  score in range â‰¤ 166 167-277 278-388 389-499 500-611 612-722 723-833
    834-944 â‰¥ 945 strand - Defines the strand. Either "." (=no strand)
    or "+" or "-".
7.  thickStart - The starting position at which the feature is drawn
    thickly (for example, the start codon in gene displays). When there
    is no thick part, thickStart and thickEnd are usually set to the
    chromStart position. thickEnd - The ending position at which the
    feature is drawn thickly (for example the stop codon in gene
    displays).
8.  itemRgb - An RGB value of the form R,G,B (e.g. 255,0,0). If the
    track line itemRgb attribute is set to "On", this RBG value will
    determine the display color of the data contained in this BED line.
    NOTE: It is recommended that a simple color scheme (eight colors or
    less) be used with this attribute to avoid overwhelming the color
    resources of the Genome Browser and your Internet browser.
9.  blockCount - The number of blocks (exons) in the BED line.
    10.blockSizes - A comma-separated list of the block sizes. The
    number of items in this list should correspond to blockCount.
10. blockStarts - A comma-separated list of block starts. All of the
    blockStart positions should be calculated relative to chromStart.
    The number of items in this list should correspond to blockCount.
